🛒 Building a Simple E-Commerce App Using DOM Manipulation & Tailwind CSS

In the vast world of JavaScript, DOM Manipulation is like a magic wand that brings web pages to life. To understand its power, let's break down a mini E-Commerce App built using pure JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. This app dynamically displays products, allows users to add/remove items from a shopping cart, and updates the total price—all through DOM Manipulation.
✨ What This App Does?

    📦 Displays Products: A list of available products is dynamically rendered.
    ➕ Add to Cart: Click a button to add a product to your cart.
    ❌ Remove from Cart: Don’t want it? Remove it in a click.
    💰 Updates Total Price: The cart’s total updates instantly.

🛠 DOM Methods Used & Their Superpowers
1️⃣ Selecting Elements (getElementById)

This method is the foundation of DOM manipulation. It helps in grabbing elements like the product list, cart, and total price section, allowing us to update them dynamically.
2️⃣ Creating New Elements (createElement)

To add new items dynamically, this method generates product cards, cart items, and buttons, ensuring that the page updates based on user interaction.
3️⃣ Adding Elements to the Page (appendChild)

Creating elements is not enough—they need to be attached to the document. This method ensures that new products and cart items appear on the webpage seamlessly.
4️⃣ Updating Content (innerHTML and textContent)

Whenever a product is added or removed, the cart and total price update in real time. These methods modify existing elements to reflect new values dynamically.
5️⃣ Handling Events (addEventListener)

Clicking buttons triggers specific actions like adding to the cart or removing items. Event listeners make the app interactive, ensuring a smooth shopping experience.
🎯 Why This Matters?

By leveraging DOM manipulation, this simple app showcases the core principles behind dynamic web applications. Whether you're building an e-commerce site, a dashboard, or any interactive UI, mastering these techniques will level up your JavaScript skills. 🚀
